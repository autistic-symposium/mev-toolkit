### tl; dr

<br>

* options can be thought of as "insurance-like" contracts where one pays a premium upfront. profits come from "disaster events", with **capped losses** and **unlimited upsides**.
* purchasers of options receive the **right** to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined **strike price**. **option chains** list **calls** (ability to buy the asset) and **puts** (ability to sell the asset) for a given expiration across a variety of **strikes**.
* options also gives leverage by chasing cheaper premiums (e.g. shortening expirations).
