### tl; dr

<br>

* a decentralized oracle network consisting of three key smart contracts:
  * a reputation contract: keep track of data providers' performance.
  * an order-matching contract: selects bids from oracles using the reputation contract.
  * an aggregation contract—and an off-chain registry of data providers.
* one of the main challenges with such a decentralized approach is the formulation of the aggregation function. 
* chainlink proposes calculating a weighted response, allowing a validity score to be reported for each oracle response.
