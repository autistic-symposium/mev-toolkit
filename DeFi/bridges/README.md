## Bridges

<br>


### Centralized Bridge

* Centralized bridges are essentially hot wallets straddling the fence between multiple chains. 
* They hold a user’s assets on one chain and issue them a corresponding amount of tokens on another chain. 
* Liquidity on both sides is managed by the centralized entity. 
* Binance is probably the best example of a centralized bridge operator, straddling the fence between Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.
* The security risks of a centralized bridge are the same security risks that exist for exchanges and custodians. 
* Their primary responsibility is securing private keys (key management), and as a result centralized bridges have proven to be pretty secure.


### Proof of Stake Bridge

* Proof of Stake bridges are like little blockchain networks narrowly focused on facilitating cross-chain activity. 
* Whereas centralized bridges are managed by a single entity, proof of stake bridges are managed by a group. 
* They often involve multisigs or some form of escrow mechanism controlled by a group of signers/validators that watch and vote on the ability to unlock corresponding assets on another chain.
* Because POS bridges involve both smart contracts and a group of centralized gatekeepers, they inherit all the code risk of Web 3 and the traditional security risks of Web 2 (key management, access controls). 
* POS bridges have the most attack vectors, and have unfortunately been the victims of most of the major exploits.


### Decentralized Bridge

* Decentralized bridges take a proof of deposit from one chain and validate it on the other chain (ex: Polygon Plasma Bridge). 
* Decentralized bridges are all code. They don’t rely on centralized signers/validators, so while there’s more code risk, they don’t have to worry about the traditional security risks that POS bridges deal with.
* Decentralized bridges are newer and facilitating less activity than the other bridge types, but there are no known exploits.
